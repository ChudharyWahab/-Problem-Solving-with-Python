Feel free to explore each program to understand its functionalities.

## Usage

To run any Python program, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the program's directory in your terminal:**
    ```bash
    cd path/to/program_directory
    ```

2. **Execute the Python file using a Python interpreter:**
    ```bash
    python program_name.py
    ```

3. **Observe the program's output or behavior in the console.**

Each program is self-contained. Feel free to modify the code, test different inputs, or explore its functionalities.

For specific instructions or additional details, refer to the comments within the Python files.
